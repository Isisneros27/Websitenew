<h1>About</h1>
	
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="Text_rules2" dir="ltr">Greetings! I'm Isaiah Sisneros, a photographer from Albuquerque, New Mexico. With a five-year photographic journey, </p>
<p class="Text_rules2" dir="ltr">I mostly capture my shots through the nostalgic allure of 35mm film, wielded skillfully by my trusty Minolta SRT-202. Occasionally, I venture into 120mm to add diversity to my visual storytelling.<br />
  </p>
<p class="Text_rules2" dir="ltr">My foray into photography began during my freshman year of high school when a serendipitous elective choice led me to a photography class. </p>
<p class="Text_rules2" dir="ltr">What started as a random assignment soon blossomed into a lifelong passion. Throughout my high school years and beyond, </p>
<p class="Text_rules2" dir="ltr">I relentlessly pursued the art of photography, earning accolades and recognition. Notably, </p>
<p class="Text_rules2" dir="ltr">my work found a prestigious place in the Albuquerque Museum, and the culmination of my artistic journey led to an exhibition at the illustrious Carnegie Hall.</p>
<p class="Text_rules2" dir="ltr"> This unexpected and remarkable trajectory has not only shaped my identity as a photographer but has also allowed me to share my unique perspective with a broader audience.</p>
